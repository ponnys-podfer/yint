Yint: A TinyMUD Compatible MUD server
-------------------------------------

While people might assume otherwise from the name, Yint is a derivative of TinyMUD. This is a fairly straight, mechanical translation of the MangledMUD code from Ruby to Hoon. (MangledMUD was a mostly mechanical translation of the original TinyMUD code from C to Ruby.)
